# Clashstats

My friends and I often do friendly 2v2 battles between eachother and I wanted a way to determine which one of us was the best.

Clashstats fetches data of all friendly 2v2 battles between clan members and creates a leaderboard based on the ranking system, which is ofter used in chest.
